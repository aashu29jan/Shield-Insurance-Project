# Shield-Insurance-Project
This repository contains the final project for my Data Analyst Internship at AtliQ Mart. The project involves using Power BI to analyze data for a fictional company, Shield Insurance, to support data-driven decision-making.

***Objective***
To enable Shield Insurance to make informed decisions by creating an interactive dashboard that provides easy insights into their data.

***Project Overview***
As an intern, I worked closely with my team to build a dashboard tailored to the client's specific needs. The dashboard provides detailed insights into various aspects of the company's performance.
